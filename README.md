## Workshop Title: The 1st Workshop on Recommendation with Generative Models


## Summary

The boom of generative models has paved the way for significant advances in recommender systems. For instance, pre-trained generative models offer unprecedented opportunities to improve recommender algorithms for user modeling. This workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers to actively explore and share innovative ideas on integrating generative models into recommender systems, mainly focusing on five key aspects: i) enhancing recommender algorithms, ii)generating personalized content in some scenarios such as micro-videos, iii) changes in the user-system interaction paradigm, iv) boosting trustworthiness checks, and v) evaluation methodologies of generative recommendation. With the rapid development of generative models, a growing number of studies along the above directions are emerging, revealing the timeliness and necessity of this workshop. The related research will bring novel features to recommender systems and contribute to new tasks and technologies in both academia and industry. In the long run, this research direction might revolutionize the traditional recommender paradigm and lead to the maturation of next-generation recommender systems. 


## Call for Papers

This workshop aims to promote innovative research on integrating generative models with recommender systems, focusing on five key aspects: 

1) improving user modeling algorithms by generative models; 
2) using generative models for diverse item content creation, to supplement human-generated content; 
3) revolutionizing user interaction modes with recommender systems; 
4) emphasizing trustworthiness in generative model-enhanced recommender models; and 
5) designing evaluation methodologies for assessing recommender systems with generative models. 

The workshop will provide a valuable platform for researchers to share the latest ideas, advances, and breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field. Prospective authors are invited to submit original research papers that address the related topics of interest. Submitted papers should not exceed 8 pages in length, including figures, tables, and references. Papers must be formatted according to the CIKM 2023 format and submission guidelines.
